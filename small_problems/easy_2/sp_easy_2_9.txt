This code should print BOB twice, because name and save_name are refering to
the same object. When the 'save_name' variable was initialized, it was assigned
to the same object as the 'name' variable, since Ruby passed the reference to
this object.

This object was then mutated by the upcase! method call on line 3,
as the upcase! method mutates the caller. This problem demonstrates the concept
of variable assignment, Ruby's nature as a pass by reference language, and the
ability of certain methods to mutate the caller.
