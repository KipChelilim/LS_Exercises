# Question 1: couldn't find File#path
~ File#path comes from the parent object IO; this is an instance method
~ File::path is a class method
~ the difference is what the method is called on
~     Class method: called on the class (File.path('bin')
~         where File is class, path is method, 'bin' is argument
~     Instance method: called on the object (f.path)
~         where f is an object == 'bin', path is the method
~ reread ruby Preparations chapter
~ remember, if an instance method isn't in the API, check the parent in case it
~     was inherited; also check older versions. this was not in 3.2.0, but it
~     was in core-2.5.1

# Question 2: uses default year of -4712 and default of 1 for day and month;
              arguments replace these defaults vs incrementing; return is a
              date object(format of #<YYY-MM-DD>), but puts calls to_s so this
              gets converted to a string version of the date

              puts Date.civil               => -4712-01-01
              puts Date.civil(2016)         =>  2016-01-01
              puts Date.civil(2016, 5)      =>  2016-05-01
              puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)  =>  2016-05-13

# Question 3: will result in an syntax error at definition, as parameters with 
              defaults must be grouped together
~ wrong: positional arguments. I read the "method" API, not "calling methods"
~ ruby will assign arguments w/o defaults, then fill in from left to right the
      ones with defaults

# Question 4: a.bsearch { |num| num > 8 }
              this works because all values > 8 come after all values <= 8
              follows expectation of all falses precede all trues

# Question 5: 
              puts a.fetch(7)                      => an error
              puts a.fetch(7, 'beats me')          => 'beats me'
              puts a.fetch(7) { |index| index**2 } => 49

# Question 6: this should print 5 and 8, order of arguments does not appear to
              matter since both are optional

# Question 7: puts s.public_methods(false).inspect
# Question 8: puts a.min(2)
# Question 9: .../3.2.0/exts/psych/Psych.html#method-c-load_file
